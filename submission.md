# Submission guidelines

Papers must be submitted [through CMT]({{ site.workshop.submission_link }}).

All submissions will go through a double-blind review process. Papers will be selected based on
relevance, significance and novelty of results, technical merit, and clarity of presentation.

For regular submissions, the maximum number of pages is 10 + 2 for references only, using the 
[LNCS proceedings format](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines).

**Each accepted paper must be covered by at least one author registration** (either a
*Full registration* or a *Workshop/Tutorial registration*, if you plan to attend
the workshops/tutorials only).

Once accepted, the presence of at least one author at the event and the oral presentation of the paper are mandatory.
