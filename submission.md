# Submission guidelines

## Paper submission

Papers must be submitted through [CMT]({{ site.workshop.submission_link }}).

## Formatting Your Manuscript

All submissions must comply with the following criteria:

- **Page Limit**: Submissions must not exceed 8 pages, including figures, tables, and text. An additional 2 pages are allowed for references only.
- **Formatting Style**: The manuscript should be formatted according to the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) style. Style files and detailed instructions can be found on the [Springer website](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines).
- **File Type**: A single PDF file will be accepted at submission time.

Authors should consult Springer's author guidelines and use their proceedings templates for LaTeX or Word. Authors are also advised to include their ORCID identifiers in their papers.
<!-- The corresponding author must fill out and sign a Consent-to-Publish form on behalf of all co-authors, and the name on the copyright form should correspond with the name marked on the paper. No changes to authorship will be permitted after submission to Springer.-->

## Double-blind peer review

We follow a double-blind review process. Authors and reviewers will remain anonymous to each other. 
Authors must prepare their submissions according to the Anonymity guidelines of MICCAI to ensure the integrity of the double-blind review process. Non-anonymized submissions will be subject to immediate desk rejection.
Papers will be selected based on relevance, significance and novelty of results, technical merit, and clarity of presentation.

## Simultaneous submission policy

In submitting to PILM 2024, authors implicitly agree that no paper with substantially similar content is concurrently under review or will be submitted elsewhere before the conclusion of the PILM 2024 review process.

<!--For regular submissions, the maximum number of pages is 12 (including figures, tables and references), using the 
[LNCS proceedings format](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines).

**Each accepted paper must be covered by at least one author registration** (either a
*Full registration* or a *Workshop/Tutorial registration*, if you plan to attend
the workshops/tutorials only).

Once accepted, the presence of at least one author at the event and the oral presentation of the paper are mandatory.-->
