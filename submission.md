# Submission guidelines

Papers must be submitted through CMT (link to be available soon). <!--({{ site.workshop.submission_link }})-->

All submissions will go through a double-blind review process. Papers will be selected based on
relevance, significance and novelty of results, technical merit, and clarity of presentation.

Additional information coming soon...

<!--For regular submissions, the maximum number of pages is 12 (including figures, tables and references), using the 
[LNCS proceedings format](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines).

**Each accepted paper must be covered by at least one author registration** (either a
*Full registration* or a *Workshop/Tutorial registration*, if you plan to attend
the workshops/tutorials only).

Once accepted, the presence of at least one author at the event and the oral presentation of the paper are mandatory.-->
