# Call for papers

## Scope of the workshop

The use of deep learning-based systems is growing fast in applications in both science
and real-world scenarios. To further improve the performance of existing models, an
increasing amount of data is needed, which also needs to be heterogeneous to
develop better and more generalizable methods. However, huge datasets mean huge
training in terms of time and computational burden. Furthermore, the collection of
large-scale, diverse centralized datasets could be practically impossible, especially in
some fields, e.g., medical domain, in which privacy and data ownership issues come
into play.

To overcome these problems, Federated Learning (FL) has been proposed to develop
better AI models without compromising usersâ€™ privacy. Different institutions can train
more robust models, benefiting from the federation, without sharing raw training data.
Particularly in medical fields, the heterogeneity of the data is very pronounced, both in
terms of the number of samples and domain shifts among the various contributing
institutions, due, for example, to the variability in equipment and image acquisition
protocols.

This workshop aims at bringing together researchers and practitioners with common
interest in FL for visual tasks, with a particular focus on medical imaging, to address
the open questions and challenges of this research area.

## Topics

The workshop aims to attract novel and original contributions exploring federated and
collaborative learning with its challenges and peculiarities.
Expected submissions should cover, but are not limited to, the following topics:
* Novel approaches of Federated, Distributed and Collaborative learning in
medical imaging applications
* Topologies: Server-centric, peer-to-peer, cyclic, swarm learning, etc.
* Decentralized learning
* Dealing with heterogeneous and unbalanced (non-IID) data distributions
* Security and privacy of FL systems
* Personalized FL models
* New Datasets for FL
* Optimization methods for distributed and collaborative learning
* Adversarial, inversion, back-dooring, and other forms of attacks on distributed
and federated learning
* Model sharing techniques
* Novel applications of FL techniques: image classification, segmentation,
reconstruction, regression; multi-task learning, model agnostic learning, meta-
learning, unsupervised
* Applications of federated, distributed and collaborative learning techniques in
medical field.
